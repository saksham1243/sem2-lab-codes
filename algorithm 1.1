algorithm of the code for deltion,insertion and linear search
Main Function:
Start: Begin the program execution.
Input n: Prompt the user to enter the number of elements (n) in the array.
Input elements: Prompt the user to input n elements and store them in the array a[].
Display elements: Print the elements of the array.
Display menu: Display a menu with options for array operations: Delete, Linear Search, and Insert.
Input choice: Prompt the user to choose an operation.
Perform operation: Based on the user's choice, call the appropriate function: delete(), linear(), or insert().
End: End the program execution.
Delete Function:
Input element to delete: Prompt the user to input the element to be deleted (x).
Search for element: Iterate through the array to find the position (pos) of the element to be deleted.
Check if element found: If the element is found, set a flag (c) to 1 and store its position (pos).
Shift elements: Starting from the position of the found element (pos), shift all elements to the left by one position to overwrite the deleted element.
Decrement array size: Decrease the size of the array (n) by 1.
Display result: If the element was found (c==1), print the array after deletion. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the element was not found.
End.
Linear Search Function:
Input element to search: Prompt the user to input the element to search for (x).
Search for element: Iterate through the array to find the position of the element (x).
Check if element found: If the element is found, set a flag (c) to 1.
Display result: If the element was found (c==1), print the position of the element. Otherwise, print a message indicating that the element was not found.
End.
Insert Function:
Input element to insert: Prompt the user to input the element to be inserted (x).
Input position to insert: Prompt the user to input the position (pos) where the element will be inserted.
Shift elements: Starting from the end of the array, shift all elements to the right from the insertion position (pos) to make space for the new element.
Insert element: Insert the element (x) at the specified position (pos).
Increment array size: Increase the size of the array (n) by 1.
Display result: Print the array after insertion.
End.

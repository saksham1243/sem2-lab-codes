The program starts by including the necessary header file (stdio.h) and defining a macro MAX_SIZE for the maximum size of the stack.
Global variables are declared, including the stack array (stack), choice for menu selection, max for the maximum number of elements in the stack, i for loop iteration, and top to keep track of the top element of the stack.
Function prototypes for push() and pop() are declared.
The push() function allows the user to input elements into the stack until it is full (top == max - 1). It prompts the user to enter values and stores them in the stack array. After pushing, it displays the elements in the stack.
The pop() function allows the user to delete elements from the stack. It prompts the user to enter the number of elements to delete (c) and then updates the top pointer accordingly. It displays the remaining elements after the pop operation.
In the main() function, the user is prompted to enter the maximum number of elements in the stack (max). Then, it enters a loop where the user can choose to push elements, pop elements, or exit the program based on their choice.
